# NestJS Timeout Interceptor

When using timeout interceptor (`TimeoutInterceptor` in timeout.interceptor.ts) with EP that returns `StreamableFile`, the interceptor doesn't work.

It does work when returning a list of string.

## How to reproduce

1. Start the app in dev mode
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/foo/file
The foo/file endpoint takes 3 seconds to resolve while the timeout interceptor sets a timeout of 10 ms
### Current behavior
File is downloaded.

### Expected behavior
A response with code 408 should be returned.

Note that the timeout interceptor works when submitting a request to `GET /foo`
